    <p>“The PM’s schedule and travel plan was communicated well in advance to Punjab Government. As per procedure, they have to make necessary arrangements for logistics, security as well as keep a contingency plan ready. Also in view of the contingency plan Punjab Government has to deploy additional security to secure any movement by road, which were clearly not deployed,” the MHA said in a statement.</p>

Speaking on a local TV channel, the CM said, “There has been no security lapse. I had been up late last night overseeing the security arrangements for his rally.

    <p>According to the MHA, the PM landed in Bathinda on Wednesday, from where he was to go to National Martyrs Memorial at Hussainiwala by helicopter. Due to rain and poor visibility, the PM waited for about 20 minutes for the weather to clear, MHA said.</p>
